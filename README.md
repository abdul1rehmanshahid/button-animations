Button Animations Project:

This project contains a set of buttons, each designed to trigger different actions such as changing the color, font size, theme, and text.
The effects are primarily random, giving a unique result each time a button is clicked, except for the toggle and theme buttons, which offer fixed, non-random possibilities.

Features:

.Color Button: Changes the  color of the h1 to a random color.
.Font-Size Button: Randomly changes the font size of the text.
.Text Button: Randomly updates the text content.
.Theme Button: Switches between two predefined themes.
.Toggle Button: Toggles between two states, such as visibility or background effects.

Usage:

Click any button to see the effects applied in real-time. While most buttons trigger random changes, the toggle and theme buttons work within a fixed set of possibilities.
